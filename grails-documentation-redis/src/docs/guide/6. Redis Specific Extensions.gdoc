As well as all the regular capabilities offered by the GORM API there are a couple of additional GORM methods that take advantage of some key Redis features. The first one is the [random|domainClasses] method which will return a random instance of the domain class:

{code:java}
def randomPerson = Person.random()
{code}

Implementing a random function in a SQL database is typically quite hard to do in a performant way whilst something like Redis makes it easy.

There is also a [pop|domainClasses] method that will return and remove a random domain instance in one step:

{code:java}
def randomPerson = Person.pop()
{code}
